\setlength{\parindent}{0.5cm} The completed work in this master's thesis has allowed to identify some models which can be used to accuratedly represent solidification phenomena. 

\noindent It has been identified thorugh the analysis of the enthalpy-porosity model some differences in the evolution of the temperature along time. The proposed library for the latent heat term uses a liquid fraction function instead of the one calculated by the phase transport equation already implemented on the solver. This is done so it could be used in the \textit{chtMultiRegionFoam} native solver for comparison purposes. The author encourages to use the liquid fraction calculated by the VOF technique instead.

\noindent It has also been shown that the proposed formulation for the implementation of the multiregion solver which accounts for multiphase fluids has not achieved the expected results. As a future work a new boundary condition regarding the coupling of two-phase flow as described in the chapter could be implemented.
